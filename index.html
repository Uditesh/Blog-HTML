        <h2>'The boys' review</h2>
        <h4>One of best series in new era.</h4>
        <p>The Boys is a television show that asks us
           “What if the Superheroes were controlled by an evil corporate company?”</p>
        <p>This show is an adaptation of the comic book The Boys written by Garth Ennis.
           The Boys is a tale of vengeance, and the path to vengeance is covered in blood.
           No, it's not like Batman, the Boys neither have the money nor the training. What the boys
           do have is a badass captain, an indomitable will and the ability to cope up with any adversity.
           With great power comes great responsibility, and great collateral damage. A lot of blood
           is spilt when these superheroes are at work, and often most of it is brushed under the carpet.

        <h2>'Tenet' review</h2>
        <h4>Another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan?</h4>
        <p>Enigmatic to a fault and exhaustingly dense, Christopher Nolan’s latest sci-fi spectacle
           leaves you with the unshakable feeling that you walked into the screening 15 minutes late.
           “Tenet” spends roughly two hours of its 150-minute run time explaining what is happening,
           why it is happening, and what might happen next. The film follows a man known only as
           The Protagonist, a CIA agent who finds himself on the hunt for
           an arms dealer with an unusual weapon: bullets that fire backward through time. It’s called
           "inversion" and with the right hardware, it can be done to anything, including cars and people.
